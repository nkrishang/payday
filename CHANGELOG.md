# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses semantic version numbers. The project is currently
pre-release software; the `0.1.0` version does not imply a stable public API.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A `payday.sh` web project (`web/`): a landing page and the hosted checkout at
  `/pay/{id}`, built with Next.js, Tailwind, and wagmi. The checkout is
  server-rendered, so it arrives complete, and a payer can pay from a connected
  wallet, a scanned QR, or a copied address.
- `PaydayPayerClient` in the TypeScript SDK — a keyless client for the public
  payer routes, so a merchant can build a checkout of their own.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on `GET /v1/payer/payments/{id}` and its
  `/qr`. No other route allows cross-origin reads.
- A `checkout_base_url` Terraform variable naming the origin that serves the
  checkout, which is where every `payment_url` points.

### Changed

- The payer link is tokenless and unauthenticated. Anyone holding it may read
  the payment and fulfil it, which is what makes it shareable; it exposes no
  payout address, refund address, memo, reference, or metadata. Documentation
  that still described a signed token has been corrected.
- `GET /pay/{id}` on the gateway now answers `301` to the hosted checkout, so
  links shared before it moved keep working.
- Payments are looked up by their complete ID or payment address; ID prefixes
  are no longer accepted.

### Removed

- The placeholder checkout that was compiled into the gateway binary, along with
  its `/assets/payer.*` routes.

### Documentation

- Added a customer [quickstart](docs/quickstart.md),
  [concepts guide](docs/concepts.md), [CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md),
  [HTTP API reference](docs/api-reference.md), and [FAQ](docs/faq.md).
- Added a customer-first repository landing page and documentation index.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Authenticated creation, listing, filtering, pagination, cancellation, and
  account-scoped lookup of single-use USDC payments by ID, prefix, or address.
- Merchant references and metadata, finalized transfer provenance, indexer
  freshness, explorer links, long polling, and hosted payer checkouts.
- Signed lifecycle webhooks with test events, delivery/attempt visibility,
  SSRF-resistant endpoints, and durable retries.
- Support for one configured EVM chain and its exact Circle native-USDC proxy
  per deployment, using six-decimal amounts and bounded invoice expirations.
- Finality-gated ERC-20 transfer indexing with cumulative partial payments,
  overpayments, expiry classification, and durable invoice settlement state.
- Batched on-chain sweeping to beneficiaries before expiry and recovery
  addresses after expiry, including collection of transfers sent after
  settlement.
- Customer lifecycle reporting for awaiting, partial, paid, settled, expired,
  returned, and attention states, with payout-support guidance.
- A `payday` CLI with email-OTP login, private endpoint-bound credentials,
  payment tracking/watch mode, key rotation/revocation, webhook management,
  JSON output, completions, built-in guides, and verified upgrades.
- OpenAPI 3.1 and interactive API references, a zero-runtime-dependency
  TypeScript client, checksum-verified release archives, install script,
  generated Homebrew formula, and isolated Monad testnet sandbox support.
- Public and authenticated service-status views with request IDs and
  per-account API rate limits.

### Security

- API keys are returned once and stored as SHA-256 digests; payment access is
  isolated by account. Rotation has a 24-hour deployment grace period and
  revocation immediately invalidates current and previous keys.
- Production signing supports AWS KMS, while local development supports an
  explicit signer key.

### Known limitations

- This is an initial pre-release; compatibility is not yet guaranteed.
- Payday does not initiate payer refunds. Cancellation is advisory and the
  merchant controls the payment's refund address.
- Accounts have one unscoped, unnamed key generation and no team/organization
  membership or source-IP restrictions.
- Each deployment supports one configured chain and one native-USDC contract.
